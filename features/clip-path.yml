description: "The `clip-path` CSS property hides part of an element according to a shape."
spec: https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking-1/#clipping-paths
# https://caniuse.com/css-clip-path is not linked here because the browser
# versions are very different, mostly due to lack of support for url() for
# external SVGs being treated as partial support. That is not essential to
# using the feature, and not even mentioned on MDN.
# TODO: align with caniuse and link it here.
